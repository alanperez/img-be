The character recognition model is trained to recognize handwritten characters from images. However, it gets stuck on one letter and performs worse than EasyOCR, an existing OCR library. The goal is to improve the model's performance, accuracy, and generalization ability.


Currently,  working on the model using EasyOCR as a baseline. I'm extracting text from images using EasyOCR and comparing it with the text generated by  the trained model. This allows it to identify discrepancies and validate the accuracy of our model's predictions.
